here you can find different codes i wrote through my learning journey to become a blockchain dev

Something I always wanted and finally got the time to do

hope I don't get depressed too much to continue

started 10/6/2023

1st checkpoint to see where i reached is at 12/2023

final checkpoint is at 6/2024

so I'm dedicating 6 ~ 12 months for this goal , will i be a dev by 6/2024 ?
